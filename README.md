# Reception

A dashboard and reverse proxy for your
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) projects. It does not require any dependencies but _Docker_ and _docker-compose_.

## About

This program shows all _docker-compose_ projects that are running on a handy overview page.
It has a built-in reverse-proxy, so that any container's exposed port are accessible as '_container.compose-project.docker_'.
In order to be able to resolve '_anything_.docker' to *localhost*, this tool also ships a tiny tiny DNS server.

As a result, you'll be able to access your _docker-compose_ projects as '*container.compose-project.docker*',
and the traffic will automatically be forwarded to the corresponding port,
even as you fire up and shut down new _docker-compose_ projects.

## Requirements

You need to have superuser privileges on your computer.

## Installation

We assume you have _Docker_ and _docker-compose_ already installed.

But for resolving `*.docker` to `localhost` (i.e. `127.0.0.1` or `::1`), changes to your host configuration are required.

### Linux

Install *reception*:

    git clone https://github.com/ninech/reception.git
    make

Proceed according to your linux configuration:

#### Ubuntu 16.04/18.04

Instead of `.docker` as TLD it's the easiest to just use `.localhost` because that's already built-in in the `systemd-resolver.service`.

Now run *reception*:

    sudo reception -tld localhost

Or install *reception* as systemd service:

    sudo make install

Now try to go to http://reception.localhost.

#### Local dnsmasq resolver

If you use dnsmasq as your local resolver, add this line to your dnsmasq config:

    address=/docker/127.0.0.1

It tells dnsmasq to resolve `*.docker` with the dnsserver listening at `127.0.0.1:53` (which will be *reception*).
Then restart dnsmasq:

    service dnsmasq restart

And now run *reception*:

    sudo reception

You should be able to http://reception.docker now.

#### Non-systemd linux

Check the content of `/etc/hosts`.
If it doesn't contain any nameservers pointing to `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.53` or `::1`, then this way of installation should work for you:

    sudo -i
    mkdir /etc/resolver
    echo "nameserver ::1" > /etc/resolver/docker
    echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" >> /etc/resolver/docker

Now run *reception*:

    sudo reception

Finally, try to go to http://reception.docker.

### macOS

Install *reception* using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew tap ninech/reception
    brew install ninech/reception/reception

Next you need to register *reception* as the resolver for the `docker` TLD. Run the
following on your command-line

    sudo -s
    mkdir /etc/resolver
    echo "nameserver ::1" > /etc/resolver/docker
    echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" >> /etc/resolver/docker

At last, start the service:

    sudo brew services start ninech/reception/reception

Now try to go to http://reception.docker.

## Configuration

_reception_ is customizable to some extend.
See `reception -h` for a complete list of configuration parameters.

    $ reception -h
    (c) 2017 Nine Internet Solutions AG
    Usage of reception:
      -dns.address string
        	Defines on which address and port the HTTP daemon listens. (default "localhost:53")
      -docker.endpoint string
        	How reception talks to Docker. (default "unix:///var/run/docker.sock")
      -http.address string
        	Defines on which address and port the HTTP daemon listens. (default "localhost:80")
      -tld string
        	Defines on which TLD to react for HTTP and DNS requests. Should end with a "." . (default "docker.")
      -v	Show version.
      -version
        	Show version.

## Tips & Tricks

### "Main" container

The "main" container defines, where the project address ends up (i.e. http://yourproject.docker):
The container should either have a docker-compose label of `reception.main` or should be called `app`:

    version: '2'
    services:
      app:    <----- like this
        image: nginx
        labels:
          reception.main: 'true'  <--- or like this
        ports:
          - 80

### Ports

In your `docker-compose.yaml` file, we advice to not specify a local port and to not export any
unnecessary ports either. _docker-compose_ will bind your exported port to any available local port,
and _reception_ will make sure, that there's a url for it.

This way, you can launch several containers that expose the same port without conflict and therefore 
avoid port collisions across projects.

**Do**

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
    app:
    image: nginx
    depends_on: pgsql
    ports:
        - 80    <----- like this
    pgsql:
    image: postgresql
```

**Don't**

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
    app:
    image: nginx
    depends_on: pgsql
    ports:
        - 80:80    <----- and _not_ like this (local port)
    pgsql:
    image: postgresql
    ports:
        - 5432:5432    <----- and _not_ like this (unnecessary port)
```

### HTTP Port

In order to detect which port of you container "the http port" is, *reception* looks for the well-known ports
80, 8080 and 3000. You can override this behaviour by setting the label `reception.http-port` to a port of your choice:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
    app:
    image: special
    labels:
        reception.http-port: '1234'  <--- like this
    ports:
        - 1234
```

## Troubleshooting

### Reception can't bind to the ports

You must run *reception* as privileged user (i.e. `root`) for it to be able to bind to port 53 (dns) and port 80 (http).

### _docker-compose_ projects can't start because of port conflicts

Most probably you assigned a fixed port mapping for an exposed port. Look for something like the following:

```yml
version: 2
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "8000:80"  <---- like this
```

In the case above, you would just replace `"8000:80"` with `80`.

### `reception.docker` does not resolve

First, check if *reception* is actually running.

Then see if `nslookup reception.docker` resolves to `127.0.0.1` or `::1` (respectively `nslookup reception.localhost` on Ubuntu).

If it doesn't, please flush the DNS cache:

```shell
# macOS
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Linux
systemctl restart named
# or
systemctl restart nscd
```

## Development

This projects requires Go 1.11 or newer.

There is a `Makefile` with targets for any common task.

**Don't just use `go build`, as it will not bundle the resources!**

### Build

To build the project, run:

    make

### Run

To run a snapshot of the project, run:

    make run

### Release

To cut a release of the project, adjust the `VERSION` file and run:

    make release
    
### Debug the Makefile

To see the commands executed by `make`, run `make` as follows:

    make <target> VERBOSE=1
    
To run `make` without having it execute any command, run `make` as follows:

    make -n <target>

### Clean

To cleanup afterwards, run:

    make clean
